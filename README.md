# CodeLab-II-Pyhton Exercises

## Module Overview

CodeLab II extends your knowledge of coding to include object-oriented programming (OOP) and GUI. You build on the  programming techniques acquired in CodeLab I and move towards deploying OOP concepts that enhance the functionality and efficiency of your builds.

Through the course of the module you will be introduced to the use of libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to begin developing programmes with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). Course content will be delivered through coding exercises and creative briefs that enable you to put newly learnt techniques into practice.

Beyond developing new technical skills, you learn about the software development cycle. Here you form an understanding of how software projects are planned, implemented and maintained in industry. The ultimate aim of CodeLab II is to develop your programming proficiency to the point where you can independently experiment with unfamiliar coding techniques and languages successfully.
## Repository Contents

### Exercises

You should aim to complete these exercises in order as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises. 

To complete the exercises:

* First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine
* Create a **separate project** for each exercise in the corresponsing chapter's exercise folder
* When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github
* Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio / Xcode project files. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.*
### Guides

Guides on cloning this repository to your machine via GitHub desktop are provided in the guides folder, alongside general information on creating a project in Visual Studio VScode.

### Resources

This folder contains files required for the file handling tasks as well as some useful code snippets.

# Getting Started

## Installing an IDE

Class demonstrations are taught using Visual Studio Code. You are welcome to use either VScode or Visual Studio. 
You can find information on how to start a project in Visual Studio or VScode in the guides provided on Lecture Materials.

## Practicing outside of class

Programming is a difficult skill to master and you will struggle to get to grips with it by coding in the classroom sessions alone. 
You need to practice coding between classes to ensure you do not get left behind. 
This workbook should be used to practice both inside and outside of class, allocating yourself time in the week to complete exercises not completed during the class.
4 -5 hours (or more) of additional practice each week will make a world of difference to your code.

## Using GitHub

Throughout CodeLab we will be using GitHub to keep track of the code we create. 
You should save the solutions to the chapter exercises in your CodeLab GitHub repository. 
Your tutor will review the code you post on GitHub in order to provide feedback on your work to help you improve. 
Guides on using GitHub can be found on Minerva and if you have any questions let your tutor know.

## 1-2-1 Tutorials

If you are struggling with any of the concepts introduced in class and would like some additional programming help 1-2-1 tutorials are always available. 
To book a tutorial drop an email to arshiya@bathspa.ae or meet the tutor in Faculty Room.
