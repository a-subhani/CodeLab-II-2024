# Task for Assessment 2 - DDA:

You are required to use one of the APIs listed below*:
- The Movie DB: https://developer.themoviedb.org/*
- Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/developers*
- Rest Countries: https://restcountries.com/
- Currency API: https://freecurrencyapi.com/*
- Open Trivia: https://opentdb.com/
- Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/
- Harry Potter API: https://potterdb.com/

&nbsp;
How you use the chosen API and the functionality you provide within your application is up to you. Making creative use of the API and/or providing the user with a range of options to query the API will likely afford higher marks. You should explore the documentation for each API to see what is possible in order to help select the API you wish to work with. 
As noted above the application should be built using the Tkinter library module. 

&nbsp;(I suggest working with event handling, have more than one search option using buttons/ free search entry field, use frames to develop multi page app, use message boxes to communicate with user, provide instructions to the user on how to use your app)

&nbsp;*The Movie Database, Discogs and the Currency API and require you to create an account to generate an API Key. You can create a key via the websites linked above. If you are unsure about how to create the key please let your tutor know
